# Governance Model Details

## Introduction
The governance model of PiStable is designed to empower the community and ensure that all stakeholders have a voice in the decision-making process. This document outlines the governance structure, voting mechanisms, and roles within the ecosystem.

## Governance Structure

### 1. Token-Based Voting
- **Governance Tokens**: Holders of the PiStable token will receive governance tokens that grant them voting rights on key proposals.
- **Voting Power**: Voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held, encouraging active participation from larger stakeholders while still allowing smaller holders to have a say.

### 2. Proposal Submission
- **Proposal Types**: Community members can submit proposals related to protocol upgrades, reserve management strategies, and other significant changes.
- **Submission Process**: Proposals must be submitted through the governance interface and will undergo a review process before being put to a vote.

### 3. Voting Process
- **Voting Period**: Each proposal will have a defined voting period during which token holders can cast their votes.
- **Quorum Requirement**: A minimum percentage of governance tokens must participate in the vote for it to be considered valid.
- **Outcome**: Proposals that receive a majority of votes will be implemented, while those that do not will be archived for future reference.

## Community Engagement
- **Regular Updates**: The governance team will provide regular updates to the community regarding ongoing proposals and decisions.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Community members are encouraged to provide feedback on proposals and governance processes to foster transparency and trust.

## Conclusion
The governance model of PiStable is designed to be inclusive and transparent, ensuring that all stakeholders can participate in shaping the future of the project.
